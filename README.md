Auto enrolment plugin for Moodle (http://moodle.org/)
=====================================================

This plugin allows for an enrolment into a course to occur automatically when a user views a course or course activity.

The course administrator can configure which activity (or activities) should trigger an enrolment when viewed by the user.

Auto enrolment can also be configured to occur upon course view.
